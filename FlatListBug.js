This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance can become very slow, and the app may freeze or crash. This is because the FlatList component renders all the items at once, even if they are not visible on the screen. To fix this, use the `windowSize` prop to control the number of items rendered at once. You can also use the `removeClippedSubviews` prop to remove items that are off-screen, which can further improve performance.
